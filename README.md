# Song_Popularity :
This project aims to predict the popularity of songs using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing song features like tempo, danceability, energy, and acousticness, the model estimates how popular a song is likely to be. The application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to input a song name and get a popularity prediction based on trained data.

**Project Workflow**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Preprocessing

Load the dataset (song_data.csv) containing song features.

Clean and preprocess the data for training.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering & Model Training

Select relevant features influencing popularity.

Train Ridge Regression to predict song popularity.

Standardize features for improved model performance.

3Ô∏è‚É£ User Interface with Streamlit

Interactive UI to allow users to select a song.

Predict popularity based on user input.

Display the results in a user-friendly way.
